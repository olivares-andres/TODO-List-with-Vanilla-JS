- The tasks are added when the user looses focus on the input or you can have your own button.
- The delete icon shows on the side of every task.
- The user can add as many tasks as needed.
- When there is no tasks the list should "No tasks, add a task"
- There is no way to update a task, the user will have to delete and create again.
